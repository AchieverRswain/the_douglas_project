Image Captioning with VGG16 and Encoder-Decoder Architecture

This project implements an image captioning model that leverages VGG16 for feature extraction and an encoder-decoder architecture to generate descriptive captions for images. The model is trained on the Flickr 8k dataset, which provides a diverse range of images and associated captions to enhance the model's ability to produce accurate and contextually relevant descriptions.

Features
->VGG16 Feature Extraction: Utilizes pre-trained VGG16 layers to extract rich feature representations from input images.
->Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Employs a combination of an encoder to process the image features and a decoder to generate captions based on those features.
->Training on Flickr 8k Dataset: Trained on the Flickr 8k dataset, which contains a diverse set of images and their corresponding textual descriptions.
